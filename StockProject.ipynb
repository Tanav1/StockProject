The problem we are trying to solve is the complexity of the stock market. It can be difficult to choose which stocks to invest in and to understand which stocks are similar to one another without having to look at complicated financials for a company. We decided to use important financial data to choose stocks that were similar to eachother and then output these choices to the user, making their lives much easier. The user of our function can input one of their favorite stocks that they own in their portfolio and then our function's output will show the user 20 stocks that are very similar. The user could then consider investing in these stocks that were outputted or just use it as informative information. We essentially are taking something like Netflix's use of recommender systems for movies but applying it to the stock market. There really aren't too many resources available for a user to get stocks recommended to them based on similarity, which is part of the reason why we wanted to do a project like this. Working hands-on with creating a recommender system and developing a scoring function gave us insight into how other companies may go about creating recommender systems. Overall, it was a fun and valuable project in which we were able to learn a lot from.

We will change the weight scoring from 0.7 to 0.8 and market cap scoring from 0.6 to 0.7. Additionally, we want to increase the weight of Earnings/Share from 0.4 to 0.7 since we want to place greater emphasis on growth stocks that have been profitable compared to stocks that are stagnant that don't have much room for growth. We will place less of an emphasis on Sector in this function and drop its scoring from 0.8 to 0.2. We are doing this because we are more concerned with matching large growth stocks with other large growth stocks and small stocks with other small stocks, so Sector wouldn't matter. We also want to place less of an emphasis on Dividend Yield because stocks that are growing tend to keep all profits for themselves so that they can reinvest in their company and help it to keep growing; so we will change this from 0.7 to 0.2. Price/Earnings will be decreased slightly from 0.4 to 0.3 since price can vary between stocks and won't really help too much in our ultimate goal of this recommender system. Price/Book will be kept the same at 0.2. Essentially, we want this recommender system to focus mainly on growth stocks that have potential to continue to grow at a rapid pace. As previously mentioned, we also want to ensure that stocks with large influence on the S&P 500 index are also recommended with eachother.

As you can see, the stocks that are recommended to it are other low market cap and low weighted stocks. This shows that are algorithm is working since we wanted to place greater emphasis on market cap and weight. Comparing this to our original functions output for Ralph Lauren, we can again see that there are recommendations from new sectors, not just the Consumer Discretionary sector.\n","\n","\n","Overall, this goes to show that there are many different approaches to a recommendation system for stocks. The best recommendation system really depends on what the user is looking for. If a user wants stocks that are generally from the same sector with similar dividend yield then our orginal recommender system would be great for them. On the other hand, if a user wants stocks that are similar based on weight in the S&P 500 index and similar with regards to market cap, then they will choose to use our new recommender system. This just goes to show that recommednations can be made on various different categories so it can really depend on what type of recommendation someone is looking for.\n","\n","Though, we do believe that our original algorithm worked very well because it was able to nicely combine weight, dividend yield, and sector in its recommendations."],"metadata":{"id":"zyT5xC4-cNvX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["RL_df_alt = test_new(\"RL\", merged_df)\n","RL_df_alt"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":812},"id":"y3S7ivZBWWQO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1650567622679,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2649,"user":{"displayName":"Nick Hatz","userId":"03110715195171617801"}},"outputId":"facfcfee-c154-4311-bae3-26e5c672d35f"},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pandas/core/indexing.py:1817: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\n","Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  self._setitem_single_column(loc, value, pi)\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Symbol                      Company Name                  Sector    Weight  \\\n","0      RL           Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.
